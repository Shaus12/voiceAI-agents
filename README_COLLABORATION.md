# 🤝 How We Work Together

## For Both Partners

### Current Setup ✅

- ✅ `main` branch - Production code (don't edit directly)
- ✅ `develop` branch - Where we integrate our work
- ✅ Feature branches - Where we do our work

---

## Quick Commands

### Start Working
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Save Your Work
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "what you did"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Get Partner's Latest Work
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
```

## Rules

1. ✅ Always create a feature branch before coding
2. ✅ Pull latest changes before starting
3. ✅ Write clear commit messages
4. ✅ Push your work regularly
5. ❌ Don't push directly to `main` or `develop`
