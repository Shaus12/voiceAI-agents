Hey! 👋

I've set up our Git workflow so we can work together smoothly. Here's what you need to do:

## Quick Setup (2 minutes):

1. **Pull the latest code:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Switch to the develop branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   ```

3. **Read the simple guide:**
   - Open `PARTNER_GUIDE.md` in the project
   - It's super short and explains everything

## That's it! 

The guide shows you:
- How to start working (3 commands)
- How to save your work (3 commands)
- What to do if we edit the same file

Everything is kept super simple - no complicated stuff!

Let me know when you're set up and we can start! 🚀
