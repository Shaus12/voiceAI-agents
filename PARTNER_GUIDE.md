# 👋 Welcome! Simple Guide to Get Started

## What We're Doing

We're working together on this voice AI project. This guide shows you the basics of how we'll collaborate.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Make sure you have the latest code

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### Step 2: Switch to the develop branch

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
```

That's it! You're ready to work.

---

## 💻 Daily Workflow (Super Simple)

### When you start working:

```bash
# 1. Get latest changes
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# 2. Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/what-youre-working-on

# Example:
git checkout -b feature/test-workflows
```

### While you're working:

```bash
# Save your changes
git add .
git commit -m "what you did"

# Example:
git commit -m "fix: workflow validation bug"

# Push your work (so I can see it)
git push origin feature/what-youre-working-on
```

### When you're done:

1. Push your final changes
2. Tell me you're done
3. I'll review and we'll merge it together

---

## 📝 Commit Messages (Keep It Simple)

Just describe what you did:

```
✅ Good:
- "fix: workflow validation bug"
- "feat: add new button to dashboard"
- "test: test workflow creation"

❌ Bad:
- "stuff"
- "fix"
- "changes"
```

---

## 🔄 What If We Both Edit the Same File?

**Don't worry!** Git will help us merge. If there's a conflict:

1. Git will tell you
2. Cursor will show both versions
3. We'll decide together what to keep
4. Or just ask me and I'll help!

---

## ✅ Before You Push Code

Quick checklist:
- [ ] Does it work? (test it)
- [ ] Did you commit your changes?
- [ ] Did you write a clear commit message?

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

Just ask! We can:
- Chat about what you're working on
- Review code together
- Fix problems together

---

## 📋 Current Tasks

Right now we're:
1. ✅ Setting up Git workflow (this!)
2. ⏭️ Testing current features
3. ⏭️ Adding Supabase

---

## 🎯 Remember

- **Work on feature branches** (not main or develop directly)
- **Pull before you start** (get latest changes)
- **Push when you're done** (so I can see your work)
- **Ask if unsure** (better to ask than guess!)

---

That's it! You're ready to go! 🎉

*Questions? Just ask!*
